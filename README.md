# Basic Web Application - Terraform on AWS

This project is a basic web application that I created using Terraform on the AWS Cloud. It was built to demonstrate my understanding of using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision cloud resources. The primary component of the project is an EC2 instance, a virtual server that hosts a simple website. I used user data on the EC2 instance, so it automatically installs a web server and builds a webpage as soon as it starts.

The project includes a Security Group, which acts like a firewall. It only allows HTTP traffic (port 80) to reach the web server.

Even though the application is simple, it demonstrates key concepts in cloud computing. It shows how to launch resources in AWS using Terraform, ensure they work correctly together, and how to secure them so the application stays safe.
